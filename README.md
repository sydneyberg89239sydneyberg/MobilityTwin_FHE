# MobilityTwin_FHE

A privacy-preserving digital twin framework for personalized urban mobility analytics, built upon Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This project enables city planners, researchers, and individuals to simulate and evaluate the effects of transportation policies on encrypted personal mobility data — without ever revealing the underlying individual behaviors.

---

## Overview

Modern cities increasingly rely on mobility data to improve transportation systems, reduce congestion, and create sustainable infrastructure. However, the use of personal movement data introduces critical privacy risks. Individuals’ travel patterns can reveal sensitive details about lifestyle, income, or health conditions.

**MobilityTwin_FHE** bridges this divide between utility and privacy. It constructs a **personalized digital twin** of each citizen’s mobility profile — but the data remains **encrypted end-to-end**. Thanks to **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, simulations and computations can be performed directly on encrypted data, ensuring that even the system operators cannot see the raw data.

The outcome: urban planners can analyze the potential impact of new traffic or transit policies at a population level while safeguarding every individual’s privacy.

---

## Motivation

Traditional urban mobility analytics face several challenges:

- **Privacy leakage**: Raw GPS trajectories expose personal identity and routines  
- **Centralized data storage**: Data silos create risks of misuse or unauthorized access  
- **Policy uncertainty**: Testing a new transportation rule may have unpredictable individual effects  
- **Low citizen trust**: Lack of transparency discourages participation in data-driven city planning  

**MobilityTwin_FHE** resolves these issues by combining **privacy-preserving computation**, **personalized simulation**, and **policy experimentation** within an encrypted ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Encrypted Digital Twins

Each citizen’s transportation pattern is represented by an encrypted digital twin.  
This twin is a mathematical abstraction that models:

- Preferred commuting routes  
- Transport modes (car, bus, bike, etc.)  
- Travel frequency and timing  
- Policy sensitivity (e.g., congestion pricing, parking availability, etc.)  

All this information remains **fully encrypted** at all stages of computation.

### 2. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

FHE allows computations on encrypted data **without decryption**.  
This means the system can:

- Simulate policy impacts  
- Calculate aggregate statistics  
- Run optimization algorithms  

…all without ever accessing plain-text user data.  
Even the server operators or city administrators cannot decrypt or view personal information.

### 3. Secure Policy Simulation

Users or city analysts can run simulations such as:

- How would reducing public transit fares affect my commuting time?  
- What would happen if a new cycling lane network is introduced?  
- How does congestion pricing impact lower-income citizens’ travel costs?  

These analyses run on encrypted digital twins and produce **encrypted results**, which are later decrypted only by authorized parties with proper consent.

## Features

- **Encrypted Personal Data Vault** – Each user’s mobility data is encrypted with an individual FHE key.  
- **Policy Simulation Engine** – Enables running policy-impact simulations over encrypted datasets.  
- **Aggregation Layer** – Computes overall city-level effects (e.g., average commute reduction) without exposing individuals.  
- **Personal Feedback Reports** – Users can view how policies might impact them personally — while keeping their raw data private.  
- **Privacy-preserving AI Models** – Machine learning models operate directly on ciphertext to infer urban mobility insights.

## Architecture

### System Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**  
   - Collects encrypted travel logs from personal devices or partner apps.  
   - Performs encryption on the client side using FHE libraries.  

2. **Encrypted Storage Layer**  
   - Stores encrypted mobility profiles.  
   - Data remains unreadable even to system operators.  

3. **Computation Engine**  
   - Executes encrypted simulations using homomorphic operations.  
   - Computes policy impact metrics (e.g., total travel time, emission reduction).  

4. **Analytics Dashboard**  
   - Presents anonymized, aggregated simulation outcomes to planners.  
   - Offers personalized, encrypted feedback channels for users.

## Why FHE Matters

Without FHE, privacy-preserving urban mobility simulations are almost impossible.  
Other approaches, such as differential privacy or secure multi-party computation, only offer **partial** protection:

| Approach | Computation on Encrypted Data | Accuracy | Privacy Level |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Differential Privacy | No | Medium | Moderate |
| Secure MPC | Limited | High | Strong |
| Fully Homomorphic Encryption | Yes | High | **Complete** |

FHE ensures that **every stage** — input, computation, and output — remains encrypted.  
This not only prevents leaks but also allows deeper, personalized simulations that were previously impossible due to privacy constraints.

## Use Cases

- **Urban Policy Testing:** Governments simulate new traffic rules without collecting raw citizen data.  
- **Mobility Research:** Academics study city-wide trends on encrypted datasets.  
- **Personalized Planning:** Individuals privately test how new regulations affect their travel habits.  
- **Sustainability Analysis:** Evaluate the environmental impact of transport reforms securely.

## Example Scenario

1. Alice agrees to participate in a city-wide encrypted mobility study.  
2. Her phone encrypts her weekly travel data using her personal FHE key.  
3. The system builds a digital twin of Alice’s behavior in ciphertext form.  
4. The city proposes a new “smart tolling” policy.  
5. The system simulates the toll’s effect on Alice’s commuting cost — **without decrypting her data**.  
6. Alice receives an encrypted result that only she can decrypt and interpret.  

Throughout the process, **nobody else** — not the city, not the platform, not even the algorithm — ever sees Alice’s travel details.
